# Additional Terms

## Trademark and branding

The "Murmur" name, logo, and associated branding elements are not covered by the MIT License above. You may not use the Murmur name, logo, or branding to market or promote derivative works without substantial modification to the codebase and explicit written permission.

The Murmur assets, images, and materials which are distributed with this source code, including but not limited to the AppIcon bundle are not covered by the MIT License above.

## App Store distribution

While you are free to use, modify, and distribute this code under the MIT License, distribution through commercial app stores (including but not limited to the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, etc.) requires that:

 1. You have made substantial and meaningful modifications to the codebase
 2. You do not use the "Murmur" name, logo, icon, or other identifying branding elements
 3. You clearly differentiate your application from the original Murmur project
 4. You provide proper attribution to the original Murmur project in your application's about/credits section

"Substantial modification" means significant changes to features, functionality, or user experience beyond simple rebranding, colour changes, or minor tweaks.

## Intent

These additional terms exist to prevent low-effort clones and cash-grab re-uploads while preserving the open-source nature of the project. If you're building something genuinely new with this code, go for it. If you're just trying to make a quick buck with a rebranded copy, please don't.
